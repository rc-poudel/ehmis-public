## Introduction

DHIS2 FlexiPortal is a customizable, deployment-ready public-facing portal that enables easy, unauthenticated access to
data stored in a DHIS2 instance. It simplifies the process of sharing data with the public by allowing DHIS2
visualizations and resources to be published with minimal effort, promoting transparency and data use.

By lowering the technical barriers to public data sharing, FlexiPortal empowers ministries of health, NGOs, and other
stakeholders to communicate insights more effectively, foster accountability, and support evidence-based
decision-making. This enhances the overall impact of DHIS2 implementations and strengthens collaboration across the
global DHIS2 community.

## Deployment

### Portal Manager

The portal manager is a DHIS2 custom application. You can install it through the App Hub or download it from
the [releases](https://github.com/hisptz/dhis2-public-portal/releases) page and manually install it in your DHIS2
instance

### Portal

There are several ways we support deploying your portal application

#### PM2

[PM2](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/) is a production process manager for Node.js applications that helps you keep your app
alive forever and reload it without downtime.

To deploy the portal app using PM2:

This installation requires node > 20 already installed in your system

1. Download the `portal` application from the [releases](https://github.com/hisptz/dhis2-public-portal/releases) page

```bash
# Make sure to replace `<app-version>` with the intended version of the app.
   wget https://github.com/hisptz/dhis2-public-portal/releases/download/v<app-version>/portal-<app-version>.zip -O portal.zip
```

2. Unzip the portal app
   ```bash
   unzip portal.zip -d portal
   ```
3. Navigate to the portal folder

```bash
cd portal
```

5. Install PM2:
   ```bash
   corepack enable 
   yarn global add pm2
   ```
6. Start the application using the provided PM2 configuration:
   ```bash
   pm2 start pm2.config.js
   ```
7. To ensure the application starts automatically after system reboot:
   ```bash
   pm2 save
   pm2 startup
   ```

The PM2 configuration file (`pm2.config.js`) is already set up to run the portal app with the name "FlexiPortal" using
the script at `apps/portal/server.js`.

#### Vercel

You can quickly deploy the application through vercel by clicking the button below.
This requires you to have a [vercel](https://vercel.com/) account.

#### Docker

You can run the portal app in docker by using the following command:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -e DHIS2_BASE_URL=https://your-dhis2-instance.org \
  -e DHIS2_BASE_PAT_TOKEN=your-personal-access-token \
  --name dhis2-public-portal \
  hisptanzania/dhis2-public-portal:latest
```

You can also use `docker compose` with this docker-compose.yml file:

```yaml
services:
  portal:
    image: hisptanzania/dhis2-public-portal:latest
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    env_file:
      - .env
    volumes:
      - public:/app/apps/portal/public

volumes:
  public:
```

Save this to a file named `docker-compose.yml` and run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables are required in the `.env` file:

- `DHIS2_BASE_URL`: The URL of your DHIS2 instance
- `DHIS2_BASE_PAT_TOKEN`: A Personal Access Token for your DHIS2 instance

### Deploying on non root URLs

In cases where your application will be available through a subpath (e.g https://example.org/some/path, you will need to
build the app yourself before deploying.

Before building your application, make sure to set the `CONTEXT_PATH` to the desired subpath. For example, the
URL https://example.org/some/path' the subpath is `/some/path`

### Docker

To build and run the application as a docker container, clone this repository to your server.

```bash 
git clone --single-branch --branch main https://github.com/hisptz/dhis2-public-portal.git
```

Then create the `.env` file in the `apps/portal/` folder. The file should have the following variables:

- `DHIS2_BASE_URL`: The URL of your DHIS2 instance
- `DHIS2_BASE_PAT_TOKEN`: A Personal Access Token for your DHIS2 instance
- `CONTEXT_PATH`: A subpath where your application will be hosted

Then run;

```bash
 docker compose -f docker-compose-build.yml up -d --build 
```

## Development Guide

This section provides guidance for developers who want to contribute to or modify the DHIS2 FlexiPortal.

### Project Structure

The project is organized as a monorepo using Yarn workspaces and Turborepo, with the following structure:

- **apps/**
    - **portal/**: The Next.js application that serves as the public-facing portal
    - **manager/**: A DHIS2 custom application for managing portal content
- **packages/**
    - **shared/**: Shared utilities and components used by both apps
    - **ui/**: Reusable UI components
    - **eslint-config/**: Shared ESLint configuration
    - **typescript-config/**: Shared TypeScript configuration

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 20 or higher)
- Yarn (version 1.22.x)
- Access to a DHIS2 instance for development

### Setup Instructions

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hisptz/dhis2-public-portal.git
   cd dhis2-public-portal
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
    - For the portal app, create a `.env` file in `apps/portal/` with:
      ```
      DHIS2_BASE_URL=https://your-dhis2-instance.org
      DHIS2_BASE_PAT_TOKEN=your-personal-access-token
      ```
    - For the manager app, create a `.env` file in `apps/manager/` with:
      ```
      DHIS2_PROXY_URL=https://your-dhis2-instance.org
      ```

### Development Workflow

#### Running the Portal App

```bash
# Run the portal app in development mode
yarn dev:portal
```

The portal will be available at http://localhost:3000

#### Running the Manager App

```bash
# Run the manager app in development mode
yarn dev:manager
```

The manager app will be available at http://localhost:3001

#### Running Both Apps Simultaneously

```bash
# Run both apps in development mode
yarn dev
```

### Testing

#### Running End-to-End Tests

The project uses Cypress for end-to-end testing:

```bash
# Run portal e2e tests
yarn portal test:e2e

# Run portal e2e tests with UI
yarn portal test:e2e-open

# Run manager e2e tests
yarn manager test:e2e

# Run manager e2e tests with UI
yarn manager test:e2e-open
```

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build all apps
yarn build

# Build only the portal
yarn portal build

# Build only the manager
